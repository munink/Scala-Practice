     * Concrete Immutable Collection Classes
     * Lists - perpetual memory consumption
     * List Maps - Key/Value pairs
     * Vectors - similar to arrays, but immutable
     * Streams - like list, but lazy elements
     * Ranges - ordered sequences of equally-spaced integers
     * (e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 10, 15, 20)
     * Immutable Stacks - last-in, first-out (LIFO)
     * Immutable Queues - first-in, first-out (FIFO)
     * Hash Ties - sets and maps using hash codes
     * Red-Black Trees - binary trees
     * Immutable BitSets - collections of integers
     * representing binary of larger integers
